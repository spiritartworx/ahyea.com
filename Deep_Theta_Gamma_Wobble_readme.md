# Deep Theta Gamma Wobble

Welcome to the **Deep Theta Gamma Wobble** project! This repository features a Python script designed to create a unique audio experience by combining Theta and Gamma brainwave frequencies with innovative modulation effects.

## Purpose and Inspiration

This project was born out of a desire to explore the intersections of art and technology, providing a tool that not only generates captivating soundscapes but also honors the legacy of Tony (Big Tone) Kujo. Tony was a visionary who devoted his life to sharing music with the world and fostering creative spaces where artists could freely express themselves. This tool is a tribute to his passion and dedication.

At ahyea.com, we are committed to developing projects that inspire and empower creativity. This script represents just one facet of our broader mission to build platforms that support artists, musicians, and creators in their artistic journeys. We hope it serves as both a valuable resource and a source of inspiration for your own creative endeavors.

## Features

- Generates Theta and Gamma brainwave frequencies.
- Applies frequency and amplitude modulation to the Theta wave.
- Dynamically pans the Gamma wave from right to left.
- Saves the generated sound as a `.wav` file and plays it in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `numpy`
- `soundfile`
- `sounddevice`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    
    ```
    
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    python -m venv venv
    
    ```
    
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On **Linux/Mac**:
        
        ```bash
        bashCopy code
        source venv/bin/activate
        
        ```
        
    - On **Windows**:
        
        ```bash
        bashCopy code
        venv\Scripts\activate
        
        ```
        
4. **Install dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    

## Usage

To generate the audio file and play it, run the following command:

```bash
bashCopy code
python src/your_script.py

```

This will create a file named `deep_theta_gamma_wobble.wav` in the root directory.
